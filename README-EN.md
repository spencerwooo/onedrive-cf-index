### ‚¨áÔ∏è Proxied / raw file download

- [Optional] Proxied download: `?proxied` - Downloads the file through CloudFlare Workers if (1) `proxyDownload` is true in `config/default.js` and (2) parameter is present in url.
- [Optional] Raw file download: `?raw` - Return direct raw file instead of rich rendered preview if parameter is present.
- Both these parameters can be used side by side, meaning that `?proxied&raw` and `?raw&proxied` are both valid.

Yes, this means you can use this project as an image storage service or for serving static files, for example:

```
https://storage.spencerwoo.com/%F0%9F%A5%9F%20Some%20test%20files/nyancat.gif?raw
```

### Others

See the new features section at the original [onedrive-index-cloudflare-worker](https://github.com/heymind/OneDrive-Index-Cloudflare-Worker#-%E6%96%B0%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A7-v11) project page for reference, **although I cannot guarantee that all features are usable.**

## Deployment

_Very, very long, tedious, step by step guide warning!_

### Generating OneDrive API Tokens

1. Create a new blade app here [Microsoft Azure App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (OneDrive normal version) or [Microsoft Azure.cn App registrations](https://portal.azure.cn/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (OneDrive ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅîÁâàÊú¨):

   1. Login with your Microsoft account, select `New registration`.
   2. Input `Name` for your blade app, `my-onedrive-cf-index` for example.
   3. Set `Supported account types` to `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`. OneDrive ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅîÁî®Êà∑ËÆæÁΩÆ‰∏∫Ôºö`‰ªª‰ΩïÁªÑÁªáÁõÆÂΩïÔºà‰ªª‰Ωï Azure AD ÁõÆÂΩï - Â§öÁßüÊà∑Ôºâ‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ∏êÊà∑`.
   4. Set `Redirect URI (optional)` to `Web` (the multiselect dropdown) and `http://localhost` (the URL).
   5. Click `Register`.

   ![](assets/register-app.png)

2. Get your Application (client) ID - `client_id` at `Overview` panel.

   ![](assets/client-id.png)

3. Open `Certificates & secrets` panel, click `New client secret` and create a new secret called `client_secret`, set `Expires` to `Never`, click `Add`, and copy the `Value` of the `client_secret` (**You only have this one chance to copy it.**).

   ![](assets/add-client-secret.png)

4. Open `API permissions` panel, select `Microsoft Graph`, select `Delegated permissions`, search for `offline_access, Files.Read, Files.Read.All`, **select all three of them** and click `Add permissions`.

   ![](assets/add-permissions.png)

   You should have these permissions ready:

   ![](assets/permissions-used.png)

5. Get your `refresh_token`. On your local machine that has a working installation of Node.js and npm (See [Preparations](#preparations) for recommendations for installing Node.js and its toolchain), execute the following command:

   ```sh
   npx @beetcb/ms-graph-cli
   ```

   <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beetcb/ms-graph-cli/master/media/demo.svg" alt="demo gif" width="560px" /></div>

   Select the options that you need, and enter the tokens that we just acquired from above. The names are self-explanatory. `redirect_url` can be set to `http://localhost`. For more information please go check out the repo at: [beetcb/ms-graph-cli](https://github.com/beetcb/ms-graph-cli).

6. Finally, create a dedicated folder for your public files inside OneDrive, for instance: `/Public`. Please don't share your root folder directly!

After all this hassle, you should have successfully acquired the following tokens and secrets:

- `refresh_token`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `redirect_uri`
- `base`: Defaults to `/Public`.

_Yes, I know it's a long and tedious procedure, but it's Microsoft, we can understand. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_

### Preparations

Fork then clone, or directly clone this repository. Install dependencies locally, you'll need Node.js, `npm` and `wrangler`.

_We strongly recommend you install npm with a Node version manager like [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which will allow wrangler to install configuration data in a global node_modules directory in your user's home directory, without requiring that you run as root._

```sh
# Install cloudflare workers official packing and publishing tool
npm i @cloudflare/wrangler -g

# Install dependencies with npm
npm install

# Login to Cloudflare with wrangler
wrangler login

# Verify wrangler status with this command
wrangler whoami
```

Login to your CloudFlare account at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/login>, select your domain, **and scroll down a bit. You'll see your `account_id` and `zone_id` there (on the right sidebar).** Also create a **DRAFT** worker at `Workers` -> `Manage Workers` -> `Create a Worker` with a cool name.

Modify [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml):

- `name`: The draft worker's name, your worker will be published at `<name>.<worker_subdomain>.workers.dev`.
- `account_id`: Your Cloudflare Account ID.
- `zone_id`: Your Cloudflare Zone ID.

Create Cloudflare Workers KV bucket named `BUCKET`:

```sh
# Create KV bucket
wrangler kv:namespace create "BUCKET"

# ... or, create KV bucket with preview functions enabled
wrangler kv:namespace create "BUCKET" --preview
```

Modify `kv_namespaces` inside [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml):

- `kv_namespaces`: Your Cloudflare KV namespace, you should substitute the `id` and `preview_id` values accordingly. _If you don't need preview functions, you can remove the `preview_id` field._

Modify [`src/config/default.js`](src/config/default.js):

- `client_id`: Your `client_id` from above.
- `base`: Your `base` path from above.
- If you are mounting regular international OneDrive, you can safely ignore the following steps.
- If you are mounting Chinese 21Vianet OneDrive (Áî±‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅîËøêËê•ÁöÑ OneDrive):
   - Set `accountType` under `type` to `1`.
   - Keep `driveType` unmodified.
- If you are mounting SharePoint:
   - Keep `accountType` unmodified.
   - Set `driveType` under `type` to `1`.
   - Set `hostName` and `sitePath` accordingly.

Add secrets to Cloudflare Workers environment variables with `wrangler`:

```sh
# Add your refresh_token and client_secret to Cloudflare
wrangler secret put REFRESH_TOKEN
# ... enter your refresh_token from above here

wrangler secret put CLIENT_SECRET
# ... enter your client_secret from above here
```

### Building and deployment

You can preview the worker with `wrangler`:

```sh
wrangler preview
```

After making sure everything is ok, you can publish your worker with:

```sh
wrangler publish
```

You can also create a GitHub Actions for auto publishing your worker on `push`. See [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).

For custom domains, refer to [How to Setup Cloudflare Workers on a Custom Domain](https://www.andressevilla.com/how-to-setup-cloudflare-workers-on-a-custom-domain/).

## Customisations

- You can **(AND SHOULD)** change the `intro` on the default landing page here: [src/folderView.js](src/folderView.js#L51-L55). Write HTML directly.
- You can **(AND ALSO SHOULD)** change the header of the site here: [src/render/htmlWrapper.js](src/render/htmlWrapper.js#L24).
- Your custom styles are loaded from [themes/spencer.css](themes/spencer.css), change that according to your customizations. You will also need to change the commit HASH at [src/render/htmlWrapper.js](src/render/htmlWrapper.js#L3).
- You can also customize Markdown CSS styles, PrismJS code highlight color schemes, etc.
