#### Under the hood

- CSS animations all the way.
- Package source code with wrangler and webpack.
- Convert all CDN assets to load with jsDelivr.
- **Almost all scripts are loaded with webpack!** (Other than a few libraries for rendering file previews.)
- ...

### Other features

#### Proxied / Raw file download

- Proxied download: `?proxied` - Downloads the file through CloudFlare Workers if (1) `proxyDownload` is true in `config/default.js` and (2) parameter is present in url.
- Raw file download: `?raw` - Return direct raw file instead of rich rendered preview if parameter is present.

Both these parameters can be used side by side, meaning that `?proxied&raw` and `?raw&proxied` are both valid. Example: [`https://storage.spencerwoo.com/ü•ü%20Some%20test%20files/Previews/eb37c02438f.png?raw&proxied`](https://storage.spencerwoo.com/ü•ü%20Some%20test%20files/Previews/eb37c02438f.png?raw&proxied).

#### Others

See: [New features - OneDrive-Index-Cloudflare-Worker](https://github.com/heymind/OneDrive-Index-Cloudflare-Worker#-%E6%96%B0%E7%89%B9%E6%80%A7-v11).

## Deployment

> Online token generation tool taken from the generous: <https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth>.

### Generating OneDrive API Tokens

1. Create a new blade app here [Microsoft Azure App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (OneDrive normal version) or [Microsoft Azure.cn App registrations](https://portal.azure.cn/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) (OneDrive ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅîÁâàÊú¨) with:
   1. `Supported account types` set to `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`. OneDrive ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅîÁî®Êà∑ËÆæÁΩÆ‰∏∫Ôºö`‰ªª‰ΩïÁªÑÁªáÁõÆÂΩïÔºà‰ªª‰Ωï Azure AD ÁõÆÂΩï - Â§öÁßüÊà∑Ôºâ‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ∏êÊà∑`.
   2. `Redirect URI (optional)` set to "Web: https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth".
2. Get your Application (client) ID - `client_id` at `Overview` panel.
3. Open `Certificates & secrets` panel and create a new secret called `client_secret`.
4. Add permissions `offline_access, Files.Read, Files.Read.All` at `API permissions`.
5. Get your `refresh_token` using <https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth>.
6. Create a dedicated folder for your public files inside OneDrive, for instance: `/Public`. Please don't share your root folder directly!

_If you can't fetch the `access_token` and/or `refresh_token` on step 5, please resolve to the solution suggested in the pinned issue [#13](https://github.com/spencerwooo/onedrive-cf-index/issues/13#issuecomment-671027672)._

After all this hassle, you should have successfully acquired the following tokens and secrets:

- `refresh_token`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `redirect_uri`: Defaults to `https://heymind.github.io/tools/microsoft-graph-api-auth`.
- `base`: Defaults to `/Public`.

### Preparations

Fork the repository. Install dependencies.

_We strongly recommend you install npm with a Node version manager like [n](https://github.com/tj/n) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which will allow wrangler to install configuration data in a global node_modules directory in your user's home directory, without requiring that you run as root._

```sh
# Install cloudflare workers official packing and publishing tool
npm i @cloudflare/wrangler -g

# Install dependencies with npm
npm install

# Login to Cloudflare with wrangler
wrangler config

# Verify wrangler status with this command
wrangler whoami
```

Create a **DRAFT** worker at Cloudflare Workers with a cool name. Get your own Cloudflare `account_id` and `zone_id`: [Docs - Account ID And Zone ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart#account-id-and-zone-id).

Create Cloudflare Workers KV bucket named `BUCKET`:

 `NOTICE: YOU NEED CHANGE THE account_id AND zone_id IN wrangler.toml BEFORE YOU DO NEXT STEPS
```sh
# Create KV bucket
wrangler kv:namespace create "BUCKET"

# ... or, create KV bucket with preview functions enabled
wrangler kv:namespace create "BUCKET" --preview
```

Modify [`wrangler.toml`](wrangler.toml):

- `name`: The draft worker's name, your worker will be published at `<name>.<worker_subdomain>.workers.dev`.
- `account_id`: Your Cloudflare Account ID.
- `zone_id`: Your Cloudflare Zone ID.
- `kv_namespaces`: Your Cloudflare KV namespace, you should substitute the `id`
  and `preview_id` values accordingly. _If you don't need preview functions, you
  can remove the `preview_id` field._

Modify [`src/config/default.js`](src/config/default.js):

- `client_id`: Your `client_id` from above.
- `base`: Your `base` path from above.

_For Chinese 21Vianet OneDrive users. OneDrive ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∫íËÅîÁî®Êà∑ÔºöÂ∞Ü `useOneDriveCN` ËÆæÁΩÆÔºà‰øÆÊîπÔºâ‰∏∫ `true`„ÄÇ_

Add secrets to Cloudflare Workers environment variables with `wrangler`:

```sh
# Add your refresh_token and client_secret to Cloudflare
wrangler secret put REFRESH_TOKEN
# ... enter your refresh_token from above here

wrangler secret put CLIENT_SECRET
# ... enter your client_secret from above here
```

### Building and deployment

You can preview the worker with `wrangler`:

```sh
wrangler preview
```

After making sure everything is ok, you can publish your worker with:

```sh
wrangler publish
```

You can also create a GitHub Actions for auto publishing your worker on `push`. See [main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml).

## Customizations

- You can **(AND SHOULD)** change the `intro` on the default landing page here: [src/folderView.js](src/folderView.js#L51-L55). Write HTML directly.
- You can **(AND ALSO SHOULD)** change the header of the site here: [src/render/htmlWrapper.js](src/render/htmlWrapper.js#L24).
- Your custom styles are loaded from [themes/spencer.css](themes/spencer.css), change that according to your customizations. You may also need to change the commit HASH at [src/render/htmlWrapper.js](src/render/htmlWrapper.js#L3).
- You can also customize Markdown CSS styles, PrismJS code highlight color schemes, etc.
